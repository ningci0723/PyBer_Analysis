# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis on data and to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods by writing Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts.


## Results

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides the comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three different types of cities which are urban, suburban and rural.

For the total rides, the result shows that there were 1,625 rides in urban cities and only 625 in suburban and 125 in rural, which means that there is a larger demand for Urban city compared to suburban and rural cities. You can find the comparison as below.

For the total drivers, it shows the similar results as the total rides. There were 2,405 total drivers in urban, compared to 490 in suburban and 78 in rural, which means that the total drivers is larger in urban, which may result of larger total rides in urban city. You can find the figure as below.

For the total fares, $39, 854.38 for urban cities is the largest number compared to $4,327.93 for rural and $19,356.33 for suburban. You can find the pie chart as below.

However, if you calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, you will find that the cost in urban city is less than cost in rural cities and suburban cities.

The multiple-line chart further indicates that the PyBer Summary DateFrame based on the trends of total fares in urban, suburban and rural cities between January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2019. The yellow line shows that the total fares in urban cities are highest with totaling from $1,600 to $2,500 compared to the red line for suburban and blue line for rural. You can find the below multiple-line chart as the reference.

## Summary

1. Considering that there are larger demand on rides in urban cities with more drivers, the CEO may need to invest more in to the urban cities, which may get a higher revenue.
2. The average cost using PyBer is greater for the riders in rural cities compared to urban cities, which may further decrease the total number of rides in rural cities in the further due to the higher average are per ride. As a result, the CEO may need to conduct a further investigation to find the reason and solve the problem.
3. The average fares per driver in urban cities is lowest compared to suburban and rural cities, the CEO may need to do more research on it and find the factors caused to it. It may discourage potential drivers from working in urban cities as drivers in rural cities can earn more than drivers in urban cities.
